# MIB Source Generator Improvements

## Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced MIB Dependency Handling
- Added logic to track and manage MIB module dependencies
- Implemented detection of unresolved imports with meaningful warning messages
- Added tracking of duplicate modules to prevent redundant compilation
- Created example files showing how to handle dependencies correctly

### 2. Performance Optimization for Large MIB Documents
- Improved the Execute method to better handle large sets of MIB documents
- Added tracking of processed modules to avoid duplicate code generation
- Implemented error and warning handlers for diagnostics
- Added suggestions for configuring projects with many MIB files

### 3. Testing with Multiple MIB Documents
- Updated the sample .mibs file to include multiple MIB documents
- Created example configurations for common MIB combinations
- Added support for testing with IF-MIB and IP-MIB together
- Enhanced the MibHelper to demonstrate usage of multiple MIBs

### 4. Improved Documentation
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Added detailed example of MIB dependency handling
- Documented performance considerations for large MIB sets
- Added debugging tips and common solutions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```
// .mibs file
IP-MIB.txt
IF-MIB.txt
```

### In Code
```csharp
// Create and use source-generated MIB objects
var ipForwarding = new IP_MIB.ipForwarding();
var ifNumber = new IF_MIB.ifNumber();

// Add to SNMP agent
store.Add(ipForwarding);
store.Add(ifNumber);
```

## Future Improvements
- Add support for incremental compilation to improve performance
- Implement caching of parsed MIB modules for faster builds
- Provide visualization tools for MIB dependencies
- Support filtering to generate code for only specific parts of MIB modules
- Resolve package dependency conflicts between SharpSnmpLib versions
